impact parameter (b)
add blue shifted to red shifted spectrum?
dark side models


wasp 121b
exoplanets.org

Papers:
2020 Gibson high res
2019 Retrivals
swaetha paper

to do:

send code

different models (Fe)

mess with veq 100km/s

plot over CC with Kp(measured) * sin(phi)

CC CO and H2O templates

Check kernel range

larger wavelength range

CC with unbroadened spectrum

check delta function kernel



WASP121-b thermal inversions
model for day and night side (h2o and co)

Kp difference plot?

planet star : 2 pi Rpl^2 flux/(2 pi Rst^2 pi bb)

sysrem uniform noise

noise
orders

odd number points Kp vsys
day-night CC

day side comparison 
flux day + night
higher res
wavelength grid !!

convolve b4 interp

check kernel sampling using np.grad (should equal dv)

Thoughts:
Veq kernel for WASP121-b much noiser than day-night kerenel (wavelength grid)
(possibly makes sense as CC is higher as less peaks means more sensitive to overlap)

Talk:
GCM (Generel Circulation Model)
orange slice model (day night on crack)
practicality of retrivals
