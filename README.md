# Rotational Broadening Kernel
Documents code written and progress of 10 week project to atempt to exploit rotational broadening of exoplanets using a simple time dependent models to improve spatial resolution.

Code implements a time dependent "kernel" to model the phases of the exoplanet as the day side changes with respect to time, thus accounting for the radial velocity of the exoplanet as it spins.
